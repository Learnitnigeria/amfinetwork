        description: `A private infrastructure industry is emerging with a simple message to the public agencies that have traditionally dominated the industry: allow us to provide a complete package of development services and we will deliver the facilities needed in less time and at little or no cost to the treasury. The pitch is compelling. Hundreds of projects costing billions of dollars have been completed using predominantly private capital in the last fifteen years. Most of the new investment created by unlocking private capital has been built in developing countries where the potential benefits of modern infrastructure are greatest.

        Public-private partnerships help fill the "infrastructure gap" between infrastructure needs and in-place facilities by exploiting a previously untapped source of capital. Applying private capital to needed infrastructure allows the public sector to complete more projects sooner than would be possible using only scarce public resources, and to divert resources to other projects, including those with less ability to attract private finance. For the private sector, investing in infrastructure projects is a potentially lucrative use for large blocks of capital. The public gains access to a higher capacity and in many cases more efficient, infrastructure system.
        
        In this manner, a government or municipality acquires at virtually no cost a facility that it would otherwise have had to finance, build, and maintain itself. When public-private partnerships provide infrastructure gratis that the government would have eventually had to finance through tax revenues or other fees, public-private partnerships replace taxation with privately collected user fees or other forms of remuneration to pay for the infrastructure.
        Infrastructure assets, especially newly constructed assets, tend to be long-lived, require minimal maintenance, capital expenditure and are generally not subject to major technological change or physical deterioration. This generally means that significant cash flow is often available from
        infrastructure businesses to service debt, make distributions to shareholders or expand the business, or all three.
        
        As a third sector company, we are strongly committed to the Sub-Saharan Continent and believe its time Africans rethink their approaches to developing our infrastructures. As populations grow and our cities become more crowded than ever, low cost public and private housing has become an increasingly important issue for our governments. However, we deeply believe low cost social housing should no longer be limited to characterless blocks of concrete. ANL aim is to facilitate the provision of extremely affordable low-cost housing to low income individuals and families who need it – while still affording them the dignity of well-designed and distinctive homes.
        Rural-urban migration is embryonic to the sprawling deplorable shanty towns and shack dwellers in overcrowded Nigerian cities and other parts of Africa. There is an ever increasing demand for affordable housing, light industrial parks, warehouses, modern markets and shopping plazas.
        With a $250,000,000 industry first bond we’re proud to be part of the Africa’s construction innovation team, creating smarter ways to help people work together, generating more value at every level, and building a better world for everyone. From coast to desert, we offer local content expertise and full construction management services including cost estimating, project financing, equipment mobilization, logistics, scheduling, quality control and safety management.
        EPC for Infrastructure
        As an industry entrant with interest  in alternative procurement, we offer the ability and flexibility to manage Engineer/Procure/Construct (EPC) teams on larger infrastructure projects. ANL consortium regularly assist owners with valuable conceptual estimating and budgeting for their projects, as well as constructability reviews prior to project procurement.
        Powered by Partnerships
        From an acute understanding of the housing and construction market to industry-leading safety programs and practices, ANL has a dedication to deliver what is promised to clients. Building relationships and client satisfaction are hallmarks of the ANL approach, and we aspire to the highest standards of ethics and professionalism.`

        Africa as a whole cannot currently feed itself; its share of world trade has halved in a generation
        Nigeria is vulnerable to the global food crisis despite its oil wealth
        Nigeria is a net importer of agricultural produce - $4.2 Billion pa including Wheat, Fish, Rice and Sugar
        Agriculture accounts for 40% of Nigeria’s GDP and 60% of Employment
        Since the 1960’s Nigeria lost a dominant position in exports of key crops such as groundnuts, ground nut oil, palm oil and Rice.
        The consequence is Nigeria faces a large and growing global agricultural market.
        Given our access to over $2billion Foreign Direct Investible funds for agribusinesses, our strategy is to create an intervention in the Value Chain: Input Producers, Farmers, Agro Dealers, Agro Processors, Industrial Manufacturers and Trade/Exports.`

      title:"OUR RENEWABLE ENERGY STRATEGY",
      description: `Amfi Network Limited in collaboration with its Technical and Financial Partners, ROLT INTERNATIONAL initiate and create partnerships in the electricity, development, training and commodity sectors in Africa. 

      In 2016 our organisation initiated a renewable energy project development business model which is based on identifying local energy needs, sourcing the international expertise, technology and financing to deliver the most cost efficient solutions that create local capacity building and job opportunities. 
      
      Our mission is to bring renewable energy to Nigeria and West African sub-region to enable development and growth through associated projects.
      
      We do this by using concepts and opportunity to build the structure and foundations needed to deliver programmes that can be implemented, are financially viable and ready to go. We facilitate local and international; PPP that addresses the energy and growth needs of communities in Africa, in a sustainable manner, with particular focus on the blend of agriculture and renewable energy at the heart of our agenda. 
      
      Rationale
      In a growing world, where the conventional forms of energy are fast moving towards extinction as well as are contributing generously to global concerns like the HYPERLINK "http://www.conserve-energy-future.com/GreenHouseEffect.php"greenhouse effect and HYPERLINK "http://www.conserve-energy-future.com/GlobalWarmingCauses.php"global warming, the need to innovate and employ alternate or unconventional HYPERLINK "http://www.conserve-energy-future.com/EnergySources.php"energy sources has become crucial for the existence of our future. Waste-to-Energy, also widely recognized by its acronym WtE is the generation of energy in the form of heat or electricity from waste. (The process is also called Energy from waste to EfW). Using fully developed and patented technology, we can utilize many millions of tons of household and industrial waste to generate a continuing supply of electricity 24/7 365 days per year.
      
      Each year millions of tons of waste are produced. Inevitably they become a part of landfill. This causes huge environmental impact in terms of wildlife, ecosystems and to human health. Nigeria in particular and West African sub-Region in general has a significant problem with waste and also a significant problem with continuous and reliable power source.
      
      Energy from waste offers recovery of energy by conversion of non-recyclable materials through various processes primarily using thermal technologies. Energy that is produced in the form of electricity, heat or fuel using combustion, depolymerisation and gasification is clean and renewable energy with reduced HYPERLINK "http://www.conserve-energy-future.com/CarbonFootPrintCalculator.php"carbon emissions and minimal environmental impact. This places these energy sources at the forefront of clean energy production.
      
      
      How We Produce Energy from Waste
      Waste treatments that are conducted involving high temperatures are called Thermal treatment. The heat generated from this thermal temperature is then used to create energy. Several countries in the world, especially in Europe are currently using Incineration as an alternate means of energy production; United Kingdom, Sweden, Germany and Luxembourg to name a few.
      
      Thermal Technologies:
      Depolymerisation uses thermal decomposition where in the presence of water, the organic compounds are heated at high temperatures. This process of thermal decomposition is called Hydrous Pyrolysis in scientific terms. The process without the use of oxygen is called Pyrolysis. Derived from Greek it is literally the synthesis of the terms, Fire and Separation. The process usually takes plastic and bio-mass as their primary ingredients. The rest works as a thermal chemical decomposition. This is again conducted at high temperatures and involves parallel changes of the chemical composition and physics often said to be a replication or representation of the conditions under which fossil fuels are created, depolymerisation has its own sets of benefits and limitations.
      
      Gasification is the process employed for waste to energy generation. Gasification converts carbonaceous substances into carbon dioxide, carbon mono oxide and some amount of hydrogen.  This process like incineration employs high temperatures to obtain results, however the major difference is that combustion does not occur by “burning” the material. Steam and/or oxygen are also used in this procedure where usually fossil fuels or organic substances are used. The gas that is produced from the whole procedure is called Synthesis gas and is considered as a good means of HYPERLINK "http://www.conserve-energy-future.com/AlternativeEnergySources.php"alternate energy. Syngas is there after used for heat and electricity production primarily among other uses.
      
      
      HYPERLINK "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrolysis"Pyrolysis is another waste to energy process, used majorly in industrial processes. Pyrolysis is just like Hydrous pyrolysis, without the use of oxygen. Pyrolysis employs agricultural waste or organic waste from industries.
      The Syngas produced from the waste material is used to power generators and therefore supply a consistent electricity supply. It is estimated that utilising the available household and industrial waste in Niger state we could construct and operate a minimum of 2500 MW electricity plant within 18-24 month period`

    title:"ECONOMIC SUMMITS, CONFERENCES, WORKSHOPS AND TRAINING STRATEGY",
    description: `Background:
    At the 2000 Millennium Summit, 189 Member States of the United Nations endorsed theMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) as a framework to fight poverty and to accelerate
    Human  Development.  Most of the constraints being faced by Developing Economies towards scaling up interventions for better results are found at the policy level and also known to
    include weak sectoral strategies, planning and budgeting; poor linkages between the various sectors and national development strategy, as well as the failure of States / National policies
    and plans to adequately address inequalities in access to funding and development services especially at the sub-national level.
    
    Building on the above, Amfi Network Limited works in collaboration with her partners in organising  International Investment and Funding Conferences, Capacity Building Workshops and Training on Investment opportunities in Nigeria. These events are targeted at accessing funding for Agricultural Development, Micro-financing, Mass Housing Development, Small & Medium sized Enterprises (SMEs) towards sustainable Rural Development in Nigeria.
    
    Our conferences and training workshops are designed to go beyond the traditional practice of bringing together participants to conference venues. They seek to create an avenue for a realistic and objective appraisal of potentials for fast growing economies in Africa in order to attract  investors to invest - especially in Development Financing for Small Scale Industries, Agriculture, Micro Finance Lending, Renewable Energy, Construction and  Housing.
    Objectives:
    
    The core objectives of our events lies in our firm belief that, whilst Nigeria and other African countries have made significant strides in courting investors both from a political perspective, it is recognised that the vast investment opportunities that exist in Agriculture, Rural Housing, Renewable Energy and SME's sector of the economies will only be fully realised once perceptions in the minds of prospective investors and international funding agencies concerning the challenges towards offering an enabling investment climate has been fully addressed.
    
    They are also design to address these challenges in relation to a conducive environment so as to attract more Foreign Direct Investment towards development and economic growth.
    
    With over 100 Investors across Europe, America and Asia usually attending our investment conferences, we approach the subject of investing not just in Nigeria but also from a standpoint which gives confidence to investors in Developing Economies by clearly demonstrating that a market-based approach to sustainable and value chain capacity building framework strategy is the best way forward.
    
    It is recognised that the current status quo which includes significant Aid and Charity based programmes cannot alone provide the mechanism for poverty alleviation and achievement of set development goals.
    
    It is our belief that a strategy is required which includes specific goals for moving communities up the value chain, for supporting the current SDGs targets and for assisting the private sector in achieving its stated objectives.
    
    Furthermore, our conferences and workshops always focus on a strategy which is market-based and not one which is purely constructed from an intellectual perspective as so often is. It focuses on practicalities to address the 'how' in terms of executing an effective implementation plan and the sustenance of effective Public Private Partnership arrangements.
    
    Our aim here is to demonstrate - examples of best practices - where this commitment is forthcoming and its positive impact on developing economies. We also look at the opportunities for private sector enterprises to progress and playa more active part in Nigeria in terms of creating their own standards of corporate governance and ethics as we adhere to the slogan
    “whilst Business cannot solve poverty, poverty will not be solved without Businesses”
    
    We have also recognised that in many Developed Countries SMEs account for anything up to 50% of GDP whilst in Africa this rarely raises much above 10%. Our events are designed to discuss various strategies for the implementation of solutions to this significant issue by developing entrepreneurial activities and creating incentives for enterprise to move to the formal economy thus achieving the objectives of wealth and employment creation which is consistent with the overall objectives of the SDGs.
    
    Amfi Network Limited in collaboration with its Technical and Financial Partners, ROLT INTERNATIONAL initiate and create partnerships in the electricity, development, training and commodity sectors in Africa.
